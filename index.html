    <h2>Artifact 1: Air Indiana Chatbot</h2>
    <div class="artifact-box">
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Air Indiana Chatbot Project</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To learn how to design, develop, and deploy a conversational AI chatbot tailored to airline customer service needs.</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> This chatbot simulates a virtual assistant for Air Indiana, guiding users through flight inquiries, booking steps, and general support. The chatbot responds intelligently to user input using ChatGPT’s built-in conversational capabilities.</p>
      <p><strong>Live Demo:</strong> <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67cc7ca7566c8191a3b99cd54b7f51d1-ai-chatbot" target="_blank">Try the Air Indiana Chatbot</a></p>
      <p><strong>Process:</strong> I used ChatGPT to create and train the chatbot by feeding it sample questions and evaluating its responses. I refined its training data by asking ChatGPT how it would respond to various user inputs, effectively teaching it how to handle common airline-related inquiries. The chatbot uses its own AI capabilities along with the contextual guidance I provided to deliver accurate and engaging responses.</p>
      <p><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> ChatGPT, prompt design, testing iterations, GitHub Pages for portfolio deployment</p>
      <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Demonstrates my ability to build AI-driven user experiences, reflecting both technical and soft skills like communication and iteration.</p>
      <p><strong>Unique Value:</strong> This project shows how AI and user-driven data training can be combined to enhance digital customer service in the airline industry.</p>
      <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Aligned with learning objectives in software development, AI, and digital transformation.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>This artifact was tailored for a regional airline audience focused on improving digital customer experience. I learned how to guide an AI model (ChatGPT) using sample data and refine responses for natural, useful conversation. Feedback from my team helped me simplify flows and align the bot with real-world user expectations. This project showed me the power of human-AI collaboration, and how prompt design plays a critical role in AI performance. I also gained hands-on experience in creating assets, presenting value propositions, and publishing work in a professional format using GitHub Pages.</p>

    <h2>Artifact 2: Computer Vision Project</h2>
    <div class="artifact-box">
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Understanding the Scope and Impact of Computer Vision</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To research, design, and present a comprehensive overview of computer vision technologies, key innovations, and applications.</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> This presentation walks through the evolution of computer vision, from early AI to deep learning breakthroughs. It highlights challenges in real-time processing, data generalization, and quality, and offers insight into how this field is transforming modern industries. Computer Vision is one of the most practical and transformative applications of artificial intelligence today. It allows machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual input, such as images or video, just like humans do. For instance, tools like Google Lens use computer vision to analyze what your camera sees and return context aware results. You can identify plants, scan QR codes, translate text in real time, or find similar products online just by pointing your phone. Similarly, on devices like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, when you tap and hold an object in a photo, the phone uses advanced object segmentation and recognition to isolate the subject, then offers options to search the web or interact with it. These experiences are powered by a combination of deep learning, edge AI, and sophisticated image processing, all under the umbrella of computer vision. This project highlights how these capabilities are built and used across industries, from mobile apps to medical diagnostics and smart city systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> PowerPoint, research on AI models like CNNs, ViTs, SAM, and real-world case studies</p>
      <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Aligned with learning objectives in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and ethical use of technology in society.</p>
