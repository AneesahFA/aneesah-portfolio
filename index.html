    <h2>Artifact 2: Computer Vision Project</h2>
    <div class="artifact-box">
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Understanding the Scope and Impact of Computer Vision</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To research, design, and present a comprehensive overview of computer vision technologies, key innovations, and applications.</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> This presentation walks through the evolution of computer vision, from early AI to deep learning breakthroughs. It highlights challenges in real-time processing, data generalization, and quality, and offers insight into how this field is transforming modern industries. Computer Vision is one of the most practical and transformative applications of artificial intelligence today. It allows machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual input, such as images or video, just like humans do. For instance, tools like Google Lens use computer vision to analyze what your camera sees and return context aware results. You can identify plants, scan QR codes, translate text in real time, or find similar products online just by pointing your phone. Similarly, on devices like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, when you tap and hold an object in a photo, the phone uses advanced object segmentation and recognition to isolate the subject, then offers options to search the web or interact with it. These experiences are powered by a combination of deep learning, edge AI, and sophisticated image processing, all under the umbrella of computer vision. This project highlights how these capabilities are built and used across industries, from mobile apps to medical diagnostics and smart city systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> PowerPoint, research on AI models like CNNs, ViTs, SAM, and real-world case studies</p>
      <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Aligned with learning objectives in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and ethical use of technology in society.</p>

  <h2>Artifact 5: Opinion and Topic Mining Based on Tweet Data - Texas Winter Storm Case Study</h2>
<div class="artifact-box">
  <p><strong>Title:</strong> Opinion and Topic Mining Based on Tweet Data: Texas Winter Storm URI (February 2021)</p>

  <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To analyze the public sentiment and key issues discussed during the Texas Winter Storm by applying AI/ML techniques to social media data (tweets).</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> This project explores how Texans reacted emotionally to the February 2021 winter storm, using large-scale tweet data scraped through snscrape. The analysis includes sentiment classification, topic extraction, and interpretation of concerns such as power outages and property loss. Sentiment analysis was performed using TF-IDF Vectorization with SVM, BERT embeddings, and Zero-Shot Classification, demonstrating diverse modeling approaches for opinion mining during disasters.</p>

  <p><strong>Process:</strong> Data was collected from Twitter using snscrape due to API limitations. Text cleaning and lemmatization were performed. TF-IDF and BERT vectorization methods were applied. SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers were trained to predict sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). Confusion matrices were used to evaluate classification accuracy. Visualizations were created to interpret the results, highlighting the emotional and infrastructural impact of the storm.</p>

  <p><strong>Tools and Technologies Used:</strong> Python, snscrape, Tweepy, pandas, sklearn, TF-IDF, BERT, Zero-Shot Classification, Seaborn, Matplotlib</p>

  <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Demonstrates the ability to collect real-time disaster data, apply multiple AI/ML modeling techniques, and interpret emotional and social impact through sentiment analysis.</p>

  <p><strong>Unique Value:</strong> This project highlights the use of both traditional and transformer-based models (SVM and BERT) to handle noisy, real-world social media data during a large-scale natural disaster.</p>

  <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Aligned with my AIML coursework objectives, this project emphasizes ethical AI data use, real-time analytics for disaster management, and enhancing public preparedness insights through sentiment mining.</p>
